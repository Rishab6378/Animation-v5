# Animation-v5
Valhalla is a majestic hall in Norse mythology where fallen warriors are taken by the Valkyries to feast and prepare for the final battle
Animation of an image involves creating a sequence of frames, where each frame is a slightly different version of the original image, 
and then displaying these frames in rapid succession to create the illusion of movement or change.
